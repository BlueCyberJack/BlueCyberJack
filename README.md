## Professional Statement
I'm Jack Colton and welcome to my Github! 

As a dedicated UK-based police officer, I specialise in investigating crimes facilitated through digital devices and the internet. This experience has sparked a strong passion for digital forensics, cybersecurity, and the evolving cyber landscape. To further develop my expertise, I have been actively self-studying IT and cybersecurity, including working towards the CompTIA Security+ certification and applying practical skills through platforms like 'TryHackMe.'

My policing career has provided me with a plethora of skills that are highly transferable to the cybersecurity field. Investigating crimes facilitated through digital devices and the internet has strengthened my ability to analyse complex data, identify threats, and assess risk within a digital setting. Working within a regulatory and compliance-driven environment has enhanced my expertise in risk management, policy adherence, and investigative procedures. Additionally, my experience and skill-set in critical decision-making, problem-solving, and intelligence gathering has equipped me to proactively identify vulnerabilities and mitigate risk.

## Objective 
My ultimate goal is to transition my policing and investigative expertise into the cybersecurity industry as an 'Incident Responder'. 

I currently lack the pratical skills and experience required to function effectively within a cybersecurity role, which is why I have set out a structured learning pathway to bridge these gaps.
